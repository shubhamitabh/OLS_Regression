# Ordinary Least Squares Regression

Contained here is a C program that fits a set of n data points to a polynomial of the desired degree, using Ordinary Least Squares regression.
This program was created as part of an entry in the BETiC-MIC event in the Inter IIT Tech Meet 2018 conducted in IIT Bombay in Dec '18.
The goal of the project was to create a non-invasive diatebes detection system using Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy.
This program was used to plot a curve between the voltage levels measured in a photo diode that measured infrared light intensity and the corresponding glucose levels of the sample.
